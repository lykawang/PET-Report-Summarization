# Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for PET Report Summarization :bookmark_tabs:

This repository contains the code for the paper (under review) [**Automatic Personalized Impression Generation for PET Reports Using Large Language Models**](#link-to-paper). 

We provided three implementations that could reproduce our results: 
- [**fastAI Implementation**](https://github.com/xtie97/PET-Report-Summarization/tree/main/fastAI)
- [**Non-trainer Implementation**](https://github.com/xtie97/PET-Report-Summarization/tree/main/nontrainer)
- [**Trainer (with deepspeed) Implementation**](https://github.com/xtie97/PET-Report-Summarization/tree/main/deepspeed)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
