# Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for PET Report Summarization :bookmark_tabs:

This repository contains the code for the paper [**Automatic Personalized Impression Generation for PET Reports Using Large Language Models**](#link-to-paper) (under review). 

We shared three implementation methods in this repository: 
- [**fastAI Implementation**](https://github.com/xtie97/PET-Report-Summarization/tree/main/fastAI): simple and easy to use
- [**Non-trainer Implementation**](https://github.com/xtie97/PET-Report-Summarization/tree/main/nontrainer): more flexible
- [**Trainer (with deepspeed) Implementation**](https://github.com/xtie97/PET-Report-Summarization/tree/main/deepspeed): reduce memory usage and accelerate training
